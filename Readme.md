# Rasa Intermediate workshop session 2 Assignment

In this assignment, you will be working on building a chatbot using Rasa. The goal of this assignment is to help you get familiar with Rasa's NLU (Natural Language Understanding) and how to create custom intents and entities. You will be required to add the following intents and training data to your Rasa project:

## Intents
- 4 faq intents of your choice
- 2 chitchat intents

## Training Data
- buy_product
- add_to_cart
- search_product

## Responses
You will also be required to add responses for each of the intents mentioned above. These responses will be the messages that your chatbot will send back to the user when the intent is detected.

## Entities
Make sure to include entities in your training examples. You can add entity values inside training examples to make them more realistic.

## Demo
Record a simple demo of Rasa shell nlu and show all the results for each intent. This will allow you to showcase how your chatbot works and how it responds to user input.

## Submission
Once you have completed the assignment, please submit your Rasa project(via github) along with the demo video. Make sure to include all the necessary files and dependencies required to run your chatbot. Good luck!
